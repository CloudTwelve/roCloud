# roCloud
This is a macropad design that I made to play ROBLOX with! It's a cloud-shaped macropad, hence the name "roCloud".
It contains 5 keys, 4 arrow keys arranged in a reverse T formation, and a larger "space-bar" key (it's more the size of an enter key) at the bottom. It's like a controller, but for ROBLOX.

(hope it's okay that it's a lil too big, it's too late anyways to fix it)
